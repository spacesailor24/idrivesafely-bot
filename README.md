# Defensive Driving Bot

So I this is probably the least ethical code I've written, but I've been through the defensive driving course once, and I mean I reeeeeeally went through it trying to scrub any value from the information it was supposed to be teaching me; The course was boring and largely consisting of topics that should be common sense.

So I got another speeding ticket, and negotiated to take the defensive driving course again, BUT this time I figured I could write a bot to do it for me in the same amount of time it would take me to go through by hand AGAIN. So this is why this is here, it works almost flawlessly...

I'm creating a repo for this, because it's cool, was my first chrome extension, and goes to show that you can always write a solution for a problem in code!
